# 🌍 Sustainable Travel Impact App

An interactive data and design project exploring how tourism, sustainability, and gentrification intersect in cities like **Medellín, Colombia** and other developing destinations.

This project aims to help travelers **visualize the impact of their travel decisions** — from local economic benefits to social and environmental effects — and make more responsible travel choices.

---

## 💡 Motivation

As tourism grows in developing cities, it brings both opportunity and challenge.  
While local economies benefit, increased foreign investment often drives **gentrification** and displaces long-term residents.  

This project asks:  
> *How can we travel more consciously — supporting local communities while minimizing harm?*
